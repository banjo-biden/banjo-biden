# About me, and this blog:

Hello, my name is JD, and I have been thinking a lot lately about how different spiritual texts and concepts apply to my life. <br><br>
This blog is my effort, mostly for myself, to collect my thoughts on everything from the Jeffersonian Bible, to the Buddhist Sutras, to Thelema, and everything in between. <br><br>
It will serve as a sort of journal, which I will try to update weekly, or as often as I can update it thoughtfully. <br><br>
I am an ordained minister based in the Apalachian Mountains, and eventually would like to create videos discussing my thoughts on different topics, texts, and theories. <br><br>
Outside of this, I am a printmaker under the name "JD The Printmaker" and run an Etsy shop <a href="https://jdtheprintmaker.etsy.com">here</a>, and can be found vending at local craft fairs. <br><br>
I also created and run <a href="https://accruehaiku.com">this page</a>, where I upload my haiku. You can go there to see a random one. <br><br>
I welcome you to this page, warmly, and wish you all of my brotherly love. <br><br>
-JD
