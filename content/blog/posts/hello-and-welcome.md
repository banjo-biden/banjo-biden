Hello, and welcome to my blog, <b>JDisWriting.com</b>. I am so very glad that you are here, and to be starting this project for myself. <br>

I am going to be using this space to reflect on what I read, what I think, and how things are going in my life. These things will encompass everything from day-to-day life, mental health, spirituality, music, and everything in between. <br>

Head over to the <a href="https://jdiswriting.com/about">about page</a> to learn a little bit about me, and check out my <a href="https://jdiswriting.com/links">links page</a> to check in on my other projects while I continue to flesh out this blog. <br>

<b>Currently Working On</b>

* Totally redesigning and rebuilding my haiku repository website at <a href="https://accruehaiku.com">accruehaiku.com</a>.
* Playing the banjo every. single. day. (learning the old time style now)
* Learning to control and live with my OCD. 
* Reading, reading, reading.

  * I would really like to take some time the next few days to dive into the Jefferson Bible. It seems like it's my speed, even if I don't normally go for that sort of thing...

  Thank you so much again for being here with me, and I wish you nothing more than all of my brotherly love. <b>-JD</b>
